      "content": "Power is a work dedicated to honour heros of the past and present of different races and nationalities. It's a project that's based on 25 characters who have made an impact on the world. Each character represents an individual. For example Nelson Mandela. Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Queen Elizabeth II, Picasso. It's a supply of just 3000. But actually we'll be breaking it down into 2. We'll be releasing 2500 of 2D art work as the genesis collection then the second collection which is the exodus collection would be 500 3D art work of the icons which would come at a different mint date. Each NFTs can be staked to earn rewards like our power token which we would be working on adding liquidity and other use for the token."
